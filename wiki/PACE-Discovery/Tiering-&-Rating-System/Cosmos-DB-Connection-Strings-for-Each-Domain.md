The PACE Systems team has worked with the Cosmos Team to provision a Cosmos DB for each domain in DV1.  Each domain has its own connection string.


[Operator connection string](https://gze-oprcdb-dv1-cdb-001.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey=dm0yReJUvng5xKDn9OSdbSSSgHr7AVV8Lz6NbVoRLIkS7cUNnPDPWtSQxxNqcr0ICPXQ5UOsEcVTjawkvnxnzw==;)

[GeoLocation connection string](https://gze-geocdb-dv1-cdb-001.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey=K1OQpK3sYltU3er2RnWDLiUWPyVTxI5rWQHsExRvIHsgrGjCOFwuHUAitKHnW78Yo5a1j5czrKP7NWG8SuNHCw==;)



<small>**Note:**  The databases have already been provisioned for each domain.  If we needed to create a new database at some point, then we'd need to work with the Systems Team and the Cosmos Team.  The PACE Systems Team cannot create the Cosmos DB themselves, but they can help us work with the Cosmos Team to get the topography approved and then complete a questionnaire detailing the specifics of the configuration specs.  They can also teach us how to work with the Cosmos Team directly.</small>
